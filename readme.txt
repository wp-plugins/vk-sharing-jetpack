Add a Vk.com sharing button to the Jetpack Sharing module

== Description ==

Extends the Jetpack plugin and allows you to add a Vk.com sharing button to the list of sharing services available under Settings > Sharing in your dashboard.

Important: for this plugin to work, you must activate [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) first, and activate the Sharing module.

This plugin is a work in progress. You can report issues [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/vk-sharing-jetpack/), or submit a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/jeherve/vk-sharing-jetpack/).

== Installation ==

1. Install the Jetpack plugin, connect the plugin to WordPress.com
2. Activate the Sharing module
3. Install the VK.com Sharing for Jetpack plugin via the WordPress.org plugin repository, or via your dashboard
4. Activate the plugin
5. Go to Settings > Sharing, and drag the Vk.com button to the sharing area.
6. Enjoy! :)

== FAQ ==

= Can I use VK's Like button instead of the Share button? =

The Like button requires an app ID and a Vk.com account. To use the Like button you would have to create your own app on Vk.com. I wanted this plugin to be simple to use, so I chose the Share button instead.

= Why is this not in Jetpack yet? =

If this Jetpack addon becomes popular, I will propose that we add Vk.com in Jetpack's Sharing module.
